Description: Here I used 2 2d array to implement 2 level hashing . My Keyset includes English Words and Bangla
Words. So one array is used for storing Bangla words and other array is used for storing equivalent english word.
Here there are some collisions but it is minimal as taking the square size of array for each slot minimizes the
collision number to less than 1/2.The number of keys in my data set is 1000.No firebase or SQL database is used in
this implementation*/
